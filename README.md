## Giving and Receiving Feedback
- Make it specific
	- If we make it sounds so vague, the feedback then sounds lazy and lack effort
- "What can I do better?" > "Wham am I doing wrong?"
- You can't know your blind spot, because, well, it's your blind spot. But your team can.
- Pay attention to non-verbal feedbacks from others.
- Other people's feedback may not 100% wrong and also may not 100% right. Just extract the right from it.
- An effective test is to choose a scenerio, write down your thoughts about it, then try to be someone outside of the situation, and write down your thoughts about it again. Compare the differences in perspective
- Development feedback(details ideas on how you can improve) > Evaluative feedback(tests)
	- DF is more personalized but cost more time
	- EF is faster but not as helpful
- Your mood is important.
	- You have good mood + normal feedback => you feel good
	- You have bad mood + normal feedback => you feel bad
	- You have good mood + good feedback => you feel great
	- You have bad mood + bad feedback => catastrophy
- If you are not ready, let the others now that you need time to process it
- Separate opinion and fact
- We are more focus on negative feedbacks(2/3 energy use for negative, 1/3 for positive). Negative memory store longer, and quicker, in long memory.
- 6 positive feedback counteract 1 negative feedback. Or at least 2 - 1(positive - negative - positive)
- Most useful feedback are real time feedbacks
	- Make informal feedback as most as you can
- If we know how to receive feedback better, we can also give better feedback
- You can also ask feedback abt how you receive feedback

# [Building Trust and Collaborating with Others](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/building-trust-and-collaborating-with-others-2)
## Building trust
- Trust is something if it's there, no one realize it. But if it's not there, everyone see.
- We don't trust to mitigate risks
- 3 ways to gain trust
	- Competence
		- Best with bossess of bosses
		- Asia managers like this
	- Empathy
		- Best with direct report
		- Afrida managers like this
	- Authenticity
		- NA EU managers like this
- Can prioritize based on context also
- Trust means risk
- To build trust: Focus on result than process
- Help your supervisor trust you by communicating about things that used to be obvious.
	- Especially it's even harder to track as we work remotely now
	- A bit about your great work will do
	- Or frequent updates. Never there's too much updates.
- "Real learning was happening because the teacher assumed the best in them"
	- 1 way to do that, use the sentence "The story I'm telling myself is __________"
- What if that people is really a jerk? The intent should still be positive.
- Sharing about yourself can also build trust.
	- Talk about yourself -> Be more open -> Connecting -> People understand you -> Build trust -> Better productivity(not need micro checks or micro managements or not need to talk much, as ppl understand and trust each other)
	- Things to share
		- Non-work stories
		- Wins and failures
		- Feelings about current work events
- You build trust when you are honest and kind. Don't lie, but also don't be rude.
- When bosses not trust you or themself, they share little, just bits of ideas at a time, and that make the team not understand not see the full picture, then they will oppose the boss even more.
- Work hard in you relationships, fill up your emotional bank account, then when you make a withdraw(you make a mistake), you don't bankcrupt the relationship
## Building Trust and Collaborating with Others

	- Collaboration spreads knowledge
	- Produces a better end result
	- More fun
- 1 way to discover and cover the basic before doing anywork
	- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231107091021.png)
- We can not choose our teammates, but we can identify early the gaps(like the skills or the preferrence) and try to close the gaps early
- Ground rules
	- At the start, discuss with each member
		- Reflect on best/worst team experiences
		- Propose one ground rule
	- Example
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231107091909.png)
		- "Any meetings more than 2 hours should have food"
	- Vote if everyone adopt the rules
- Having close relationship with someone is very helpful in work. People be more calm. They trust each others more. They treat issues and problems as objective, not as personal things. You know them, so you know they have good intention.
- "You can't microwave relationships". It take time
## Effective Listening
- Listening focus
	- Evaluating the content
		- 1 -> Best
	- Understanding the big picture
		- 2
	- Empathizing with the speaker
		- 3
	- Attending to subtle cues
		- 4
	- Recalling details
		- 5
- Every type of listening shines best in the specific environment
	- When you go to doctor and he say things you need to pay attention
		- => Not time for empathizing
		- => Time for details listening, and the big picture
	- We usually have a default listening style that we are inclined to, and it's best for us to pick the style based on the situation
- Listening challenges
	- Mental filters
		- Most pervasive
		- "A dirty filter cause more harm than help"
		- "We hear what we want to hear"
		- In short, less bias and conventional thinking. Zoom out. Don't let them prevent us from listen opening.
	- Multitasking
		- "Great communication make the opposite person feel like they are the only one in the room"
	- Distraction by delivery
		- Remind yourself that you aren't there to judge the delivery abilities of the speaker. Rather, you are here to learn something from what they say.
	- Information overload
	- Inappropriate response
- Take notes differently, based on the purpose
	- Learning mode
		- Listen for the big picture
	- Action mode
		- Capture particulars
- Listening Behaviors
	- Clarify your role
	- Use effective nonverbals
	- Honor silence
	- Paraphrase
	- Mirror nonverbals
- Information processing preference
	- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231110104217.png)
	- Men is more on logic, women is more on the other side
- Some people listen better when they move or fidget. "kinesthesis". Maybe I'm one
## Having Difficult Conversations
- If you do not have conflicts, it means you are not growing
- Take it as an opportinities to growth
- Factors that impact the situation. The more we answers them first, the more we can make better decisions.
	- The situation
		- Something happen that you don't want
		- Or something not happen but you want to happend
	- Relationships
		- It can be someone you care about more than others
	- Power Structure
	- The emotions
		- What are the emotions the other ppl has, or you has
- It's important to aware of the other person's pattern. And it is also important to aware of your pattern. It's easier to change our pattern and that will affect the other person's pattern
- "The more people added to a threat, the higher the intensity"
- Face to face is better, as it show true emotions. Journaling can help too. When in bad mood, don't tell seek other opinions, don't defend yourself, just don't respond. Face-to-face is the best. Or an onling meeting
- Don't get distracted. Which will make you forget the objective. Or go to past events or non-relevant things
- 85% of our 60k thoughts daily is negative or repetitive
- "If we already assume we know someone's motivations, we won't want to seek out to understand them."
	- Counter confirmation bias by just being curious
- Be clear about the situation, don't just "complain"
- Try to not exaggerate when in difficult conversations, which leads to escalation
	- Owning Your Emotions
		- "I'm frustrated." vs "Lisa's frustrating me."
	- Separate experience(frustration) vs issue(Lisa is interuptting people)
- "Is this conversation worth it"
	- Focus on what you want > what you don't want
		- Focus on what you don't want make you procrastinate
	- If you can see the big picture, the risk turn out to be worth take
- The more we talk abt the future instead of the past, the more positive our conversations can be
- When others or you are in negative, ask "What choices do I have". When we have choice, we find power.
- 4 types of resistence:
	- SAND
		- Stuck
		- Attach
		- Negative
		- Distracted
- Distraction is like avoidance. But avoidance happen before the conversation, distraction is in the conversation
- The one who listen first will control the conversation
	- Only once a person feel that he is heard, he start to listen
	- We don't have to show agree. Just out attentiveness to the conversation
	- Respond rather than react
	- After their first expression, pause, then ask them more. Resist the urge to reply/argur
- The biggest trap is not their resistance. It is your resistance agaisnt their resistance.
- The resistance has 1 thing in common: The lack of willingness
- Even if they keep resis, you still has 3 choices
	- Accept
	- Set boundary
	- Make a change
## Communicating with Diplomacy and Tact
- We either init a conversation or react to it
- A tactful and diplomacy message contain the essentials of formulation, politeness, timing consideration, right amount of energy spend on words
- "Tatiana, thank you for meeting with me. I've been troubled by the way we're handling this project and I wanted to give you my perspective.I know that you and Pat are colleagues and.."
	- Sometimes, a 2 seconds warm up can help the other receive our request easier
- Negative politeness
	- Negative politeness addresses, the need for others to not be imposed upon or inconvenienced Negative. Politeness always involves a layer of deference.
	- "I'm sorry to bother but do you happen to have the time"
		- You admit the fact that vou are a possible burden or a disruption? You use the less direct line of, do you happen to versus what time is it.
- Timing depends on the situation, and most important, the person you are dealing with
- "When I sense the intense on the emails or messages, I always choose to pick up the phone or to have a short meeting"
- Every situation is unique, and you need to consider the right:
	- Audience
	- Approach
	- Tone
	- Channel(way to communicate)
## Communicating with Empathy
- 2 types of empathy
	- emotional empathy
		- the normal kind
	- cognitive empathy
		- the one when we actively empathetic
- sympathy and empathy
	- sympathy
		- focuses on your perspective
		- describe what we feel abt others
		- sympathy is feel what the other ppl feeling
	- empathy
		- focuses on the other person's perspective.
		- when we remove our feelings and focus on others
		- not hijack the conversation like, "nice, when i had that, i did ..."

- introverts tends to need time alone to process new information
- to give feedback to others, focus on the major points only, which will help others easier to process 1 by one
- when talking in groups that's different than ours
	- eliminate the group
	- when only 2 ppl(from each group) talking, they more likely to orientate toward solution
	- each presentation can then talk to their group abt what the other group thinking
		- people are more open to hear opposing opinions when them come from someone they know
## Collaborative Leadership
- "you do not only need to focus on how people work, but also on how people work TOGETHER"
- the trend of leadership changed from command and control to influence and include
	- not because of it is wrong, but irrelavant recent days
- when in group, focus on the quantity of ideas, not quality. encourage everyone to contribute. encourage to either add new ideas or add additions to existing ideas.
	- 1 phase for idea generation. no judge
	- 1 phase for idea evalutation
	- just like the writing process, 1 is writing freely, 1 is editting strictly
- deal with negative
	- Use the LCS model
	- Like - What I like abt your idea
	- Concerns - What concerns do I have abt your idea
	- Solve - How we can solve these concerns
- if 1 person dominate the whole group conversation, break down the group into smaller parts (to reduce the domination)
- encourage introverts
	- switch from verbal discussing to writing notes
- 3 types of people that usually deny collaboration
	- people that want to keep the knowledge their own
	- people that stay on the past and find no more use of new knowledge
	- people find that they already know the answers
- 3 levels of trust
	- trust in yourself
	- trust between team members
		- competence trust
		- emotional trust
	- trust in leader
